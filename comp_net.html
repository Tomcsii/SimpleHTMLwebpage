			Stand Alone Computer: A Stand Alone Computer is a desktop or laptop that is used on its own without a
			connection to LAN (Local Area Network) or WAN (Wide Area Network) or a network of computers. As long as a
			network connection is not mandatory within a computer it is a Stand Alone Computer

	<div align="left">
		<font size="4">
			Networked Computer: A Netwroked Computer is a inexpensive computer with minimal specs overall and designed
			to connect to the internet or a network. Instead of relying on the specs of their computer they rely on the
			network servers, a network can be a group of seperate computers connected together.

					New programs on stand alone computers must be set up one by one

					Standalones are harder to monitor other users but you also do not interfere or affect other users
