				<td>
					A CPU or Centeral Processing Unit is the primary component of a computer that carries out
					instructions of a computer program, It preforms the basic input and output, logical and arithmetical
					operations in a computer.

				<td>

					Motherboard

				</td>
				<td>
					The Motherboard is a printed ciruit board that acts like a centeral hub of a computer as it manages
					all other parts and every other computer hardware component will be attached to it.
				</td>

				<td>
					RAM
				</td>
				<td>
					RAM or Random Acess Memory is where the Operating systems data and aplication proragms that are
					being currently used or opened are kept so thay can be quickly accesed and managed by the computers
					processor,

					Hard Drive
				</td>

					The Hard Drive or HDD is a Storage device it stores all your data, applications, files etc . It is
					made up of a hard disk which is where all your files and folers are phisically located.
				</td>

				<td>
					Solid State Drive
				</td>
				<td>
					A Solid State Drive or SSD is another storage device in your computer. Unlike a Hard Drive it is not
					made up of a Hard disk and SSD's do not have any moving parts insted SSD's store data using flash
					memory, which are typically faster than Hard drives

				<td>
					GPU
				</td>
				<td>
					A GPU or Grpahics Processing Unit, is a processor specifically designed to calculate and process
					graphics operations within a computer.

				<td>
					Cooling
				</td>
				<td>
					Cooling sytems in a computer are meant to keep the computer cool and to remove lots of the acces
					heat in the computer to keep it from overheating. The cooling system in a computer is most commonly
					fans, and a strong ventilation system.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr bgcolor="#EC8B5E">
				<td>
					Power Supply
				</td>
				<td>
					a Power Supply Unit or PSU is the computer hardware component that supplies power to a computer, It
					intakes the rwequired amount of power/electricity and converts the AC to DC current and distibutes
					the power into the computer.
				</td>
